# Terra Core Integration Tests

This project is meant to increase the success ratio of new core releases, improve reliability and features for [@terra-money/feather.js](https://github.com/terra-money/feather.js). This tests are written using TypeScript with [jest](https://jestjs.io/) and tries to improve the coverage by asserting as many outputs as possible.

### Development

This set of tests must run out of the box in Linux-based systems installing [GoLang 1.21.5](https://go.dev/), [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) and [screen](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/screen-command-in-linux-with-examples/). The relayer used in the tests is [go relayer](https://github.com/cosmos/relayer). Keep in mind that the data is not wiped out each time a new test is executed.
