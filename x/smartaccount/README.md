# smart-account

This module upgrades accounts on Terra to be smart accounts. Smart Accounts will be able to have different authentication methods, hooks that run before and after a transaction to perform checks. All logic will be written in CosmWasm for ease of upgrade and allows third-party devs to add more modules that could be used in the future.
