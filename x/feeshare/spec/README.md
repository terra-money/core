# `feeshare`

## Abstract

This document specifies the internal `x/feeshare` module of Juno Network.

The `x/feeshare` module enables the Juno to support splitting transaction fees between the community and smart contract deployer. This aims to increase the adoption of Juno by offering a new way of income for CosmWasm smart contract developers. Developers can register their smart contracts and every time someone interacts with a registered smart contract, the contract deployer or their assigned withdrawal account receives a part of the transaction fees.
